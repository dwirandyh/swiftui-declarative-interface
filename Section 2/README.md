# Building List and Navigation

### List()
To show items into list same as UITableView. if we want to populate data to `List()` we should set `id` on second parameter or we can add parameter `id = UUID()` in the model and make sure the model is `inherited` from `Identifiable` as well

### Preview Asset
if we want to use dummy image only for previewing our UI, we can put the images into `Preview Content` -> `Preview Assets.xcassets`

### NavigationView()
`NavigationView` is wrapper for View if we want to navigate between view. We can wrap the button/view inside the `NavigationLink(destination:){}`

### onTapGesture()
Using this property to detect when View is clicked (same as add onclick on view)
